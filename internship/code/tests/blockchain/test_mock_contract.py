"""Tests for mock staking contract.

This module contains tests for the MockStakingContract class, which provides a mock
implementation of a staking contract for testing purposes. Tests cover all major
staking operations including:
    - Basic staking and unstaking
    - Minimum/maximum stake limits
    - Partial unstaking
    - Rewards calculation and claiming
    - Error handling for invalid operations

Typical usage example:
    blockchain = MockBlockchainState()
    contract = MockStakingContract(blockchain)
    contract.stake(address="0x123", amount=Decimal("1.0"))
